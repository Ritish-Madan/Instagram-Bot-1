# Instagram-Bot-1
Have created a new Instagram Bot using selenium WebDriver in Python. I have added some automated features to fetch some important insights of top 10 food bloggers, we can also follow, unfollow, like/dislike images using this Instagram Bot.

---> **Works that have been implimented in this repository are: <---

1. Login to your Instagram Handle
  
  (a)Submit with sample username and password
2. Type for “food” in search bar and print all the names of the Instagram Handles that are displayed in list after typing “food”. I have avoided printing hashtags for ready to use results.
3. Searching and Opening a profile using 
  (a) Open profile of “So Delhi” 
4. Follow/Unfollow given handle - 
  (a) Open the Instagram Handle of “So Delhi”
  (b) Start following it. Print a message if you are already following
  (c) After following, unfollow the instagram handle. Print a message if you have already unfollowed.
5. Like/Unlike posts
  (a) Liking the top 30 posts of the ‘dilsefoodie'. Print message if you have already liked it.
  (b)Unliking the top 30 posts of the ‘dilsefoodie’. Print message if you have already unliked it.
6. Extract list of followers
  (a)Extract the usernames of the first 500 followers of ‘foodtalkindia’ and ‘sodelhi’.
  (b)Now print all the followers of “foodtalkindia” that you are following but those who don’t follow you.
7. Check the story of ‘coding.ninjas’. Consider the following Scenarios and print error messages accordingly -
